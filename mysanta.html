                            "My Santa" has risen above all, bringing cheer and gifts to whoever may not get one likely. We provide them not just a gift box, but a special Christmas which they would remember.</p>

                            to have a direct approach with the children to realise how abled they are and how compassionate they should be to others. My Santa had a flying start at MGLC Anandamkudi School near Kuttampuzha.The next phase of My Santa will
                            begin by December 2021.</p>

                            to be part of this initiative. Rather than reaching out to orphanages, schools or old age homes who usually get to receive a lot of privileges, we targeted the people who are isolated at home due to their physical or mental
                            disabilities.

                    <h3>About Us</h3>
                    <p>My Santa is a project initiated by the Kites Foundation to brighten the tiny lives darkened by the shadow of the pandemic. The project aims at sharing happiness with the disabled who are orphans, wheelchair users and senior citizens.
                        The process consisted of donating wheelchairs to the needy and a package including a cake and their favorite present as a gift hamper. What makes it unique is that we have found the most needful people, and figured out their most
                        desirable gift from their guardians, and surprised them with the same wrapped in bunch of love and happiness, along with their favorite cake.My Santa was held splendidly across all districts of Kerala, recalling the importance
                        of cultivating the value of acceptance and appreciation of everyone in our society.

                        </br>
                        </br>Sharing is caring. Giving is loving. With immense happiness, we are proud to proclaim that the My Santa initiative by the Kites Foundation bloomed smiles on many faces. My Santa made this Christmas special for all of us. We would
                        like to extend our words of gratitude to all Santa’s who joined us in the journey. Such little acts of kindness by you all made 2020 a bright one despite the darkness. We hope you all would join us in our future endeavours as well.</p>

                                ensuring the comfortability of each of our beneficiaries by being their own companions and there by making them mentally peaceful and strong.

                                a gift for them.The next step initiates in welcoming cake donations from compassionate home bakers and preparing the favorite flavored cake for each beneficiary.
