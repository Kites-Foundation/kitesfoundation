              Volunteerism is an important and increasingly popular system for young people to devote
              their time, effort, and talent to a need, cause, or mission without financial gain. As we realize that
              volunteerism has gained very minimal recognition in our country, it is our core responsibility to
              recognize and appreciate the Volunteers, and Volunteer activities across the nation.
